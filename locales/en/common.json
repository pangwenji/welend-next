    "section-1-description": "Credit card spending is increasingly convenient these days, with perks like cash rebates and mileage points making it even more attractive. However, many people also agree that these benefits may lead to overspending, and coupled with hidden terms, may result in unaffordable levels of financial burden. Here are 4 hidden terms on card debt:",
    "term-1-title": "Hidden Term 1",
    "term-1-description": "A lot of people prefer to repay their card debt with minimum repayment amount only, but neglect the fact that this amount bears compounding interest. This can amount to interest rates as high as APR 36% and an accumulation of even more card debt over time! For example, a $20K card debt could charge up to $117,832 of interest over 5 years!",
    "term-2-title": "Hidden Term 2",
    "term-2-description": "Due to its compounding nature, monthly interest expenses can roll over and accumulate into larger card debt overtime if only the minimum repayment amount is settled! For example, a $20K card debt can incur an interest expense charge of $49,550,  which is even higher than the principal loan amount!",
    "term-3-title": "Hidden Term 3",
    "term-3-description": "As long as your current outstanding card debts are not fully paid, interest is charged on your current outstanding amount as well as any new spending.",

    "term-4-description": "Many people prefer repaying by interest-free-hire-purchase programmes instead of full upfront product payment, but these programmes may not be interest free all the time! Interest may be charged if there are any outstanding amounts on your card. Apart from hire purchase, insurance payment and Octopus card auto top-up can also charge interest too – even your transportation expenses are interest-charging!",

    "solution-3-description": "Your repayment record is one of the key factors in impacting your credit score. It does not just reflect your financial management ways. Regardless of how punctual your regular repayment schedule is, only 1 day late in repayment, can corrupt your credit score. Therefore when it comes to credit card repayment, 1 day late is too late.",
